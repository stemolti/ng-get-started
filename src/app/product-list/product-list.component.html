<h2>Products</h2>
<div *ngFor="let product of products">
  <h3> <a [title]="product.name + ' details'">{{product.name}}</a></h3>
  <p *ngIf="product.description">
    Description: {{product.description}}
  </p>
  <button type="button" (click)="share()"> SHARE</button>
</div>

<!--

With *ngFor, the <div> repeats for each product in the list.

Structural directives shape or reshape the DOM's structure, by adding, 
removing, and manipulating elements. For more information about structural 
directives, see Structural directives.

Inside the <div>, add an <h3> and {{ product.name }}. The {{ product.name }} 
statement is an example of Angular's interpolation syntax. 
Interpolation {{ }} lets you render the property value as text.

<!--

Angular doesn't create the <p> element if the product's description property is empty.
